# Technologies Used :

I have used various technologies, such as: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap- for writing and designing the website. 
Javascript and Jquery were used to add functionality to the website. I also used Python along with Django as a web framework for a rapid, secure website.
I added POSTGRESQL as a relational database in order to be able to add custom functions developed using the programming languages.

# Testing : 

1. This app was tested by inspecting it and using responsinator.com , Contents of my webapp are fully visible on all screen sizes

2. Webapp passed all test taken by using the (python3 manage.py test)

3. I also tested it by creating multiple accounts and pretending to be a user to see how the app behaves and also see whether all forms are working as well as the payment. Based on my trial everything worked perfectly.

Bugs = sometimes after registering the login form would not allow user to login.

# Deployment :

1. pushed files to heroku 

2. Connected my Github repository to Heroku 

3. Deployed and ran my app . 

Deployment: is making the website Live and accessible by anyone who opens the link provided. 
Development: is using Git commands to upload the file used in the making of the website to GitHub in order to be downloaded or viewed by the assesor and checked. To run my code locally, and ensure that it perfectly works, the user should download the source files used along with the HTML code and run it on their device.
